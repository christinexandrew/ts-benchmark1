"# Time Series Benchmark Project" 
Hybrid Forecasting Benchmark (ts-benchmark1)

A Rigorous Comparative Framework for Statistical, Deep Learning, and Hybrid Time-Series Forecasting

Author: Christine A
Supervisor: (Denica H)
Institution: (Eduvos )
Degree: MSc Dissertation Research Project

Overview

This repository contains the complete reproducible pipeline implemented for the MSc dissertation:

“A Hybrid SARIMA–XGBoost Framework for Multi-Domain Time-Series Forecasting within a Rigorous Comparative Framework (RCF)”

The project systematically evaluates:

Statistical Models:
ARIMA, Holt–Winters, Prophet, Linear Regression, Naïve, Mean

Deep Learning Models:
LSTM, GRU

Hybrid Model:
ARIMA + XGBoost residual correction

Evaluation Framework:
SMAPE, MAPE, MASE, RMSE, MAE
Friedman Test, Diebold–Mariano Test
Residual white-noise diagnostics (ACF/PACF, Ljung–Box)
